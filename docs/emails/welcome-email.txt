Dear <researcher>

Welcome to the Gaia Data Mining platform at https://dmp.gaia.ac.uk/

Your new account has been created

    User name :   <username>
    Pass phrase : <password>

Please note both the username and pass phrase are case sensitive.

Once you login, the front page of Zeppelin should show a folder under /Users for your notebooks.

To get you started we have included some example notebooks which demonstrate how to apply different analyses methods using the Gaia data.

Each user is given 2 directories on the file-system for their own use. Each user gets a 1Gbyte home directory, "/home/{username}", which you can use to store private information like passwords and authentication tokens. Each user is also given 10Gbytes of space on the shared file-system at /user/{username}, which is for storing the results of your analyses.

Have fun experimenting. If you have any issues please contact us via the support email address, <gaiadmp-support@roe.ac.uk>, and we will be happy to help.

Cheers,
