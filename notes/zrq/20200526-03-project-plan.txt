                    301 redirect to Zeppelin site with login token in the URL.

        We have enough requirements to justify a project website, separate from the Zeppelin website.
        Placing this functionality in our own website should development easier.
        Trying to fit this functionality into the Zeppelin website means modifying it to fit with a 3rd party structure.
        If we decide to include Jupyter as well as Zeppelin, then we would have to re-write code embedded Zeppelin.
        If we decide to allow webservice access, then we would have to re-write code embedded Zeppelin.

    Zeppelin login

        Zeppelin user/pass login not used.
        Same model as IRIS login to OpenStack Horizon GUI.

        Zeppelin landing page extracts login token and converts it to user login.
        301 redirect to Zeppelin with session cookies set.


    Account registration micro-service

        Separate web service, used by the main website, also available via REST API.

        Guest/anon users are all connected to the same Spark instance ?
            Sounds simpler but in reality, probably not.
            Would need to limit any changes to the instance to prevent cross contamination.
            Would need to cleanup any changes to the instance when a user leaves.
            Lessons learned from covid - disposable PPE is easier

        Guest/anon users get their own Spark instance ?
            Disposable scalable deployments are easier to manage.
            No need to clean the instance, just destory it.
            Lessons learned from covid - disposable PPE is easier

        Guest/anon users get limited resources.
