    'Current prototype' project
    https://github.com/wfau/aglais/projects/22

        Do we need this as a project ?
        Is there a better name ?
            .. maintenance ?

    'Fine tune Spark/Yarn configuration'
    https://github.com/wfau/aglais/issues/103

        Very useful, but needs to be linked to specific notebooks to make it reproducible.


* GAVIP portal
   * https://gavip.esac.esa.int/
   * Document the user experience from login to running a notebook.
      * Which bits are nice which bits are clunky ?
      * Can we run some of our example notebooks on this platform ?
   * Issue #

* Document the user experience in GAVIP as a template to work from
* How a user gets access (entry point)
* What resources they can book (policy)
   * Deliverable: A wiki page to address this



    Apache Livy
    https://livy.incubator.apache.org/

Does this help with what we need ?
How does this integrate with Zeppelin ?










### Reservation vs queue - need to describe how the queue would work

### Shared vs individual clusters - proposed design has both
- I think we need to look at both.
- Shared clusters for anon and beginners
- Reserved clusters for large analyses

### Roles & groups - what roles and groups do we need
### Single Zeppelin vs per user - is this different to #1
### Separate Github project per service
How we ensure the storage is separate - technical issue
