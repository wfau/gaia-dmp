    Zeppelin/Spark

        We need to be able to build and modify the Docker images used in the K8s deploy.
            - aglais-zeppelin
            - aglais-spark

        Issues with building locally
            - Images are too large to upload via ADSL line.
            - Refactor the Dockerfile to add interpreters and plugins incrementally.

        Issues with building remotely
            - Out of space on VM image
            - Out of date builder image
            - Need an Ischnura VM with 32G of space.

        Yet another builder ..
            Desktop has ADSL upload issues
            Ischnura VMs have space issues
            Can we deploy an up to date builder on our K8s cluster?
            Can a container run podman and buildah ?
            K8s deploy for a vanilla Fedora 33 image
                Install podman
                    Dockerfile for a Fedora 33 builder
                        Git, Java, Maven, Podman ...
                        All the tools needed to build our Zeppelin and Spark images
                        - tedious round of test/fix/test/fix to get it right
                        - build the builder image
                        - post to registry
                        - run the builder image
                        - build Zeppelin





    Drupal

        Re-visit the deployment.
            - Deployment notes from start to end
            - Add a SSL loadbalancer

        We need to be able to debug the IAM OAuth process.
            - Need a Drupal deployment with SSL
            - Kubernetes ingres with SSL ?

        Are the issues with IAM OAuth with IAM or OAuth ?
            - Deploy IAM OAuth on Zeppelin as a test.

        Persistent volume for MariaDB.

        Offsite backup for MariaDB.

        Install theme

        Create booking items


    Kubernetes

        We need the CSI plugins to enable on-demand storage for both Cinder and Manila.
        https://docs.openstack.org/magnum/train/user/index.html#kubernetes
            cloud_provider_enabled
            cinder_csi_enabled
            csi_attacher_tag
                The tag in the cluster settings
                    ..
                points to the plugin container image here
                    https://quay.io/repository/k8scsi/csi-attacher?tab=tags
            csi_provisioner_tag
                The tag in the cluster settings

                    https://hub.docker.com/r/k8scloudprovider/cinder-csi-plugin/tags

        CSI plugin for Manila
            Not critical, the in-kernel on demand plugin seems to work.

        CSI plugin for Cinder

            Need to be able to create volumes for Drupal, and MariaDB.

            Need to be able to create volumes for Zeppelin and Spark temp space.
            Automatically allocated on a per session basis.

        Notes for how to deploy SSL ingress for Drupal
        or do we add the SSL support to Drupal ?

        Deploy SSL ingress for the K8s dashboard.
