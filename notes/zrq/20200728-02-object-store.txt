    List of Jars to include

        https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-common/3.3.0
        org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-common:jar:3.3.0

        org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:jar:3.3.0

    Looks like we already have most of these in the jars directory.

        Missing hadoop-aws.
        Get the same version as the rest of the jars.

            org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.2.0

        Trying to add jars using the 'spark.jars.packages' config property.
        Totally ignored.
        Tried using the interpreter setting page in the GUI.
        https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/usage/interpreter/dependency_management.html

            No errors, just does nothing.

        Tried explicitly setting it in the notebook
        https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/interpreter/spark.html#2-loading-spark-properties

            %spark.conf
            spark.jars.packages org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.2.0

            No errors, just does nothing.

        https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/usage/interpreter/dependency_management.html


        This sounds nice, but isn't available
        https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/interpreter/spark.html#3-dynamic-dependency-loading-via-sparkdep-interpreter

            %spark.dep
            z.load("org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.2.0")

            >   Interpreter spark.dep not found


        Our deployment seems to be ignoring settings.
        Which might explain the problems we encountered with pyhton version.




        Solve one problem at a time.
        Skip spark.jars.packages.

        Try adding the jar to our Docker image.
