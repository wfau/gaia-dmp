        Spark submission mode, [client|cluster].

            Client mode, the Spark driver is launched in-process in the submitter.

            Cluster mode, the Spark driver is launched in a separate node (Pod).

            Zeppelin has a setting property for submit mode, buit it doesn't seem to make any difference.
            Zeppelin interpreter ignores mode property and runs Spark driver as part of the interpreter.

            Zeppelin launches the Spark interpreter in a separate node (Pod).
            Configuration controls scope of the Spark interpreter, [global, per notebook].

            Zeppelin launches the Spark interpreter using the interpreter-spec template
                aglais-zeppelin/k8s/interpreter/100-interpreter-spec.yaml

            Zeppelin on Kubernetes
            https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/quickstart/kubernetes.html

                "Zeppelin can run on clusters managed by Kubernetes.
                 When Zeppelin runs in Pod, it creates pods for individual interpreter.
                 Also Spark interpreter auto configured to use Spark on Kubernetes in client mode."

                Key benefits are:
                    Interpreter scale-out
                    Spark interpreter auto configure Spark on Kubernetes
                    Able to customize Kubernetes yaml file
                    Spark UI access


        CephFS persistent volume claims

            Spark documentation describes properties for adding persistent volume claims to driver and executor nodes.

                spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.mount.path=/gaia-dr2
                spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.mount.readOnly=false
                spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.options.claimName=gaia-dr2-volume-claim

                spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.mount.path=/gaia-dr2
                spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.mount.readOnly=true
                spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.options.claimName=gaia-dr2-volume-claim

            No problem getting them to work for the executor nodes.
            Unable to get them to work for the driver/interpreter node.

            Zeppelin launches the Spark interpreter using the interpreter-spec template
                aglais-zeppelin/k8s/interpreter/100-interpreter-spec.yaml

            The interpreter-spec template has template fields for specific properties.
            Only the properties in the template are passed on to the Spark interpreter.
            The template does not have anything to handle things like persistent volume claims.
            In theory we could add our persistent volume claim to the template.

            Worth a try, but before we do, worth checking to see if we need it.

            My guess is we need the CephFS share visible from the driver in order to enumerate the
            contents of a directory (count the parquet files and share them to the executors).

            Simple test - can we scan a directory of parquet files from just the executor nodes.
            Need to get some test data onto the CephFS share.
            Turns out harder than expected.

                Can't change the access mode of the persistent volume and persistent volume claim.
                Needed to delete and re-create the persistent volume claim.
                In the process, the dynamic allocation driver created a new CephFS share.
                Need to change the persistent volume claim to re-use an existing CephFS share.

            With persistent volume access mode ReadWriteOnce, we get a filesystem permission error.

                Created a new share with ReadWriteMany mode.

            With persistent volume access mode ReadWriteMany, we get a filesystem permission error.

                The mounted directory is owned by root:root.
                Zeppelin launches Spark with the non-root uid 185.

                We need to add a vanilla Linux Pod that can access the same CephFS share.
                Ideally, we should use a container with the S3 client.

        TODO
            Add Fedora Pod with write access to the persistent volume claim.
            Add the S3 client, iterate the list of files in our S3 buckets.
            Download the Parquet files and store them on the mounted share.

            Run Zeppelin/Spark task to scan Parquet files in the CephFS share.

        Multi-user
            Add static users to the Zeppelin config
            Do we get separate Zeppelin contexts for each user.

            Add the OAuth proxy in front of Zeppelin
            How does that map to the Zeppelin users ?

        How do we create per user storage ?
            Needs to be accessible from all the executor nodes.
            Per user CephFS share would be a good candidate for that.

        Running Apache Spark on Kubernetes using PySpark
        https://towardsdatascience.com/ignite-the-spark-68f3f988f642

            "When data in the form of a Resilient Distributed Dataframe (RDD) is manipulated
             by your Spark application, the RDD is split into a number of partitions and
             distributed across these worker node/executor combinations for processing."

            "The final result is aggregated across the nodes and sent back to the driver."

        Which means the driver node will need temp space and user space.
        We need a separate driver/interpreter node for each user.


            "In cluster mode, after you submit an application using spark-submit, the SparkContext
             created on behalf of your application will ask the kube-apiserver to setup a driver
             node and a number of corresponding worker nodes (Pods) and proceed to run your
             workload on top of them."

            "Once all the data processing has finished, on tear down, the ephemeral worker node Pods
             will be terminated automatically but the driver node Pod will remain so you can inspect
             any logs before manually deleting it."


            "In client mode, you create the Spark driver node as a Pod then create a SparkContext
             using your favorite language’s API bindings before finally submitting work."

        Zeppelin interpreter runs Spark driver in-process in the interpreter Pod.
        We need separate interpreter Pod per user/notebook.

        The driver mounts work because it is launching Spark in cluster mode.
