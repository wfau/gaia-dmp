    Encountered errors with our cluster load balancers.
    Decided to delete the old cluster and create a new one.


# -----------------------------------------------------
# Setup Kubernetes cluster using clouds.yaml configured with application credentials
#[user@desktop]

    source "${HOME}/aglais.env"
    pushd "${AGLAIS_CODE:?}/notes/zrq"

        # Delete Kubernetes cluster
        gedit 20200904-01-cluster-delete.txt

        # Create Kubernetes cluster
        gedit 20200828-01-magnum-cluster.txt
