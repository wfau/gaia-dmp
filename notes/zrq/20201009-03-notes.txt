    Cluster create works :-)
    Monday-Thursday lost due to unknown issue on the Openstack platform.
    Need to track down what the cause was, and how likley is it to occur again.

    Our cpu quota has been increased.
    See if we can create a larger cluster, using all 200 cpu ?

    Split the terraform template into bash or Ansibe steps.
    Automate the cluster config process to make it faster.
    Combine all the Helm charts into one set.

    Push the limits:
        Create VMs until we run into the cpu limit.
        Create VMs until we run into the memory limit.
        Create shares until we run inti a limit.

    Follow up on the cluster create problem.
        How likley is this to happen again ?
        How likley is this to effect all of the projects at once ?

    Mount the existing Gaia share in Spark (rw for now).

    Create a new share for Nigel to work with.

        Mount Nigel's share in K8s Spark nodes to test.
        Read the CephFS mount secrets from inside the K8s Pod.
        Mount Nigel's share in a VM, using CephFS fuse mount.
        Add that to Stelio's deployment for Nigel to use.


        %spark.conf

        spark.executor.instances 10

        spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.mount.path        /gaia-dr2
        spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.mount.readOnly    false
        spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.options.claimName gaia-dr2-claim


        spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.mount.path        /user-data
        spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.mount.readOnly    false
        spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim.gaia-dr2.options.claimName user-xxxxx-claim <-- dynamic per user share
