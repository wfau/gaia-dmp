    Adding the labels during the create:

        openstack \
            --os-cloud "${cloudname:?}"-super \
            coe cluster create \
                ....
                ....
                --label "foo=bar" \
                --label "foo.aglais.uk=bar" \
                --label "http://labels.aglais.uk/foo=bar" \
                "${clustername:?}" \


    The create labels override all the labels from the template:

        {
        ....
        "labels": {
            "http://labels.aglais.uk/foo": "bar",
            "foo": "bar",
            "foo.aglais.uk": "bar"
            },
        ....
        }


    Which means the create fails, because it needs the template labels:

        {
        "status": "CREATE_FAILED",
        ....
        "faults": {
            "default-worker": "Resource CREATE failed: Error: resources.kube_masters.resources[0].resources.master_config_deployment: Deployment to server failed: deploy_status_code: Deployment exited with non-zero status code: 1",
            "default-master": "Resource CREATE failed: Error: resources.kube_masters.resources[0].resources.master_config_deployment: Deployment to server failed: deploy_status_code: Deployment exited with non-zero status code: 1"
            },
        ....
        }


    Merging the labels during the create:

        openstack \
            --os-cloud "${cloudname:?}"-super \
            coe cluster create \
                ....
                ....
                --merge-labels \
                --label "foo=bar" \
                --label "foo.aglais.uk=bar" \
                --label "http://labels.aglais.uk/foo=bar" \
                "${clustername:?}" \

    None of the custom labels make it through the validation process:
