    Where we are ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Zeppelin fails with FileNotFound issue with reading Parquet files into Spark.
    Possibly linked to the transition from Ubuntu to Debian and Java-8 to Java-11 ?

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Zeppelin fails with NoClassDefFoundError for JDBC and XML classes.
    Looks like some of the standard J2EE libraries are missing.
    Seem to remember this on another project ?

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Mysterious network issues with Dashboard seem to have disappeared.
    Suspect something change in the platform network configuration.

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Errors with JSON base64 encoding of secrets between Drupal OAuth2 server and OAuthProxy.

    Get Zeppelin working again.
    Resolve the issues with Java and Debian versions.
    Resolve the issues with NoClassDefFoundError.
