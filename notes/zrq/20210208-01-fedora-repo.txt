    Quick test to see if we can solve the problems with resolving the Fedora reposrityry.
    Try configuring dnf to use the UK mirror service.

    pushd /etc/yum.repos.d/
        for repo in *.repo
        do
            echo "---- ----"
            echo "Repo [${repo:?}]"
            sudo sed -i '
                s/^metalink/#metalink/
                s/^#baseurl/baseurl/
                s|http://download.fedoraproject.org|http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.fedora.redhat.com|
                ' "${repo:?}"

        done
    popd

    Fails because mirrorservice only has data for 32 and 33?
    Directories for 30 and 31 are empty.

    http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/30 - empty
    http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/31 - empty

    http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/32 - OK
    http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/33 - OK

    Suggests this would work - once we have updated.
    Alternative - create our own caching proxy site.
    Add this to the infrastructure node.

    # Issue solved by forcing DNF to flush the metadata cache.
    # Using the Ansible DNF plugin to check something is present.
    # Picked 'kernel' because it is on every machine.

    - name: "Update the DNF cache"
