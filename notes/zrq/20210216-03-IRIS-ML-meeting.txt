            ML for Science course is free

        Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

            lots of params
            needs big data to train

            deep neural networks tend to overfit to training datasets
            what works for one survey doesn't work on another survey - even on the same telescope

            networks are sensitive to orientation
            rotate the image and the network doesn't recognise it

            Group-equivariant convolutional neural networks help to solve this

                Will we start to change the design of instruments to match the needs of ML?
            Pete Clarke
                Instruments will become smarter, with computing built in
                line between instrument and analysis will become blurred
