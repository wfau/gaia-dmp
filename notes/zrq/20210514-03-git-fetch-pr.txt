    Target:

        Fetch a copy of the code for a PR request from the upstream (Aglais) repository.

    Result:

        Success :-)

    Thanks to Bert Belder (piscisaureus) for the howto
    https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Checkout the target branch.
#[user@desktop]

    source "${HOME:?}/aglais.env"
    pushd "${AGLAIS_HOME}"

        # Use a copy of our repository, just in case
        cp -a github-zrq aglais-copy

        pushd aglais-copy

            # Note - in my case 'upstream' refers to the main Aglais repo
            # and 'origin' refers to my fork. Change the names accordingly.

            # Add the upstream PR to the fetch list
            # https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247
            # https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247#gistcomment-430273

            git config --add remote.upstream.fetch "+refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*"

            # Fetch the upstream PR#480 branch to a local branch called 'mypr-480'
            git fetch upstream pull/480/head:mypr-480

            # Change to the local branch
            git checkout 'mypr-480'
