    Target:

        Prototyping create user functions.

    Result:

        Work in progress

        shares created manually
        access permissions already set

        new function just adds an element to this list
        using yq to edit in place, or just append ?

# -----------------------------------------------------

    access control

        zeppelin node - impersonation means notebooks run as uid,gid
        worker node   - all jobs run as 'hadoop' user

        if zeppelin runs as 'uid:user'
        if hadoop   runs as 'hadoop:hadoop'

        shares are owned by 'uid:hadoop'
        shares allow rwx access to o and g

        zeppelin notebooks can access because uid is wrx
        hadoop workers     can access because gid is wrx


# -----------------------------------------------------

    space

        mount /home on zeppelin as an openstack volume
        means we can disconnect it if we need to
        means we can re-use it if we need to
