    Target:

        Prototyping create user functions.

    Result:

        Work in progress

# -----------------------------------------------------

    local functions

    createuser

        createshirouser-cli
            remote createshirouser-zep
                name, hash

        createlinuxuser-cli
            remote createlinuxuser-zep
                name, uid, home

        createusershare-cli
            openstack
                path, size, uid, gid

            local  mountusershare-zep

                cephfs-mount.sh
                cephfs-mount.yaml

                    mntpath
                    mntmode
                    mnthost default('zeppelin:masters:workers')

                    cephuser
                    cephkey
                    cephpath
                    cephnodes

# -----------------------------------------------------

    existing function

        create-user-shares.sh

            read list
            common/manila/usershares.yaml

                  - id: "nch"
                    cloudname: "iris-gaia-data"
                    sharename: "aglais-user-nch"
                    mountpath: "/user/nch"

                  - id: "zrq"
                    cloudname: "iris-gaia-data"
                    sharename: "aglais-user-zrq"
                    mountpath: "/user/zrq"

            foreach <share>
                cephfs-mount.sh
                    cephfs-mount.yaml


        shares created manually
        access permissions already set

        new function just adds an element to this list
        using yq to edit in place, or just append ?

# -----------------------------------------------------

    access control

        zeppelin node - impersonation means notebooks run as uid,gid
        worker node   - all jobs run as 'hadoop' user

        if zeppelin runs as 'uid:user'
        if hadoop   runs as 'hadoop:hadoop'

        shares are owned by 'uid:hadoop'
        shares allow rwx access to o and g

        zeppelin notebooks can access because uid is wrx
        hadoop workers     can access because gid is wrx
