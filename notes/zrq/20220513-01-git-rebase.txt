    Target:

        Rebase and merge before we add more.
        Resolve conflicts with upstreamn changes.

    Result:

        Work in progress.
        The rebase worked, but ended up re-comitting a lot of Stelios's commits.
        See how this works when we merge into master.
        Probably easier to create a new branch based on main and use meld to combine the changes.
